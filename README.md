Project idea for assessment: Conference-App

Formulation of the problem

Imagine that you are at a conference and you need to quickly enter the contacts of people with whom you communicate or have communicated before in the database, so that you can find them in a convenient way later. Or even build more complex algorithms for finding contacts and taking actions with them. For example, you are going to speak at a conference in Berlin and you need to automatically write a nice message to everyone who lives nearby, with an offer to meet for coffee. This is a kind of networking assistant.

Functionality:

1. The user should be able to do a photo of a personâ€™s conference badge
2. Extract information from the photo: (Name, Position, Company)
3. Detect if a QR code is present, and open and parse information from the QR code link.
4. Save information to CRM (use Notion API) 
5. Add the geo-location where this photo was made
6. Do a search on LinkedIn and get a profile link + Company website. Add to CRM +DB.
7. Do website parsing -> save text into DB. Extract TAGs from parsed text and assign these TAGs to the company. (see Example below)
8. The user should have his profile where he put his TAGs (what he is interested for)
9. After analysis show the report to User (Match: High, Medium, Low)
